<p>The National Rifle Association is a divisive and influential force in America. I was intrigued by their impact and almost-cult following and decided to focus my project on the NRA. Because I am neither American nor knowledgeable about the current state of American gun legislation, I researched both pro and anti gun arguments. I can now confidently take my place among the gun-control advocates and mock the NRA.</p>
<p>The right to bear arms is protected by the Second Amendment. Second Amendment fundamentalists argue that stricter gun laws would infringe upon this constitutional right. This might be true if amendments were God-given or inalienable, however, amendments are subject to change by definition. There have been 27 amendments to the constitution since it was first implemented; The 18th being prohibition and the 21st being an appeal of prohibition. The US government has and can change its mind.</p>
<p>Additionally, within America's Constitution, the Fifth Amendment states that no person shall be deprived of life without due process of law. Despite this, gun laws in the United States allow for killing in self-defence (Stand Your Ground Law and Castle Doctrine). American law is contradictory and can be applied differently depending on interpretation. 
Therefore the Constitution is neither set in stone nor infallible and cannot be unequivocally revered as the 'word of God' or absolute truth.
</p>
<p>Another argument against gun control is that it simply doesn't work. However, many countries have successfully implemented gun control as a means of preventing gun violence.</p>
<p>On April 28, 1996, a man opened fire at Port Arthur, Australia with a semi-automatic firearm. 35 people were killed and 18 were injured. By May 6, 1996, the Australian cabinet had endorsed a policy for nationwide regulation of firearms. The new policy required gun owners to licence and register all firearms. Gun owners were also required to justify their gun ownership with a reason, including sport, farming, hunting, etc. Self-defence was not on the list of accepted reasons to own a gun. Additionally, all automatic and semi-automatic firearms were banned. Citizens who found themselves in possession of newly illegal firearms were incentivized to sell the item back to the Australian government, receiving financial compensation. At this time, 600,000 firearms were surrendered which equated to approximately 30% of all privately owned firearms in Australia. Since this implementation of stricter gun laws, there have been no mass shootings.</p>
<p>Some American gun lobbyists have argued against Australia's successful gun control, citing that since mass shootings are relatively rare, their concentration in one decade, and absence in another, is merely a statistical anomaly. If so, allow me to present a few more statistical anomalies:</p>
<p>The American states with the most lenient gun laws rank among the states with the most gun deaths per capita; Oklahoma, Mississippi, Alabama, Alaska, and Louisiana. Furthermore, the five states with the strictest gun regulations, rank among the states with the lowest gun deaths per capita; Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Hawaii, New York, and Connecticut. About 75% of gun owners say that their reason for owning a gun is self-protection; however, gun owners are twice as likely to use their gun on themselves than they are to use it on anyone else. For every gun death in self-defense, there are 34 gun homicides and 82 gun suicides. Finally, 61% of US adults say it is too easy to legally obtain a gun in the country and 58% of US adults are in favour of stricter gun laws.</p>
<p>So, why are they not being implemented?</p>
<p>The answer is simple- the NRA- the most powerful gun lobbyist group in America. The NRA was founded in 1871 as a recreational group, but it has grown into one of the most powerful political organisations in the US. It lobbies against all forms of gun control and argues that more guns make the country safer. The NRA wields significant influence over politicians through campaign contributions and public mobilisation. It directly funds the politicians and lawmakers who support them and spends millions of dollars lobbying per year.</p>
<p> I believe that the NRA is an organisation which verges on criminal. Now, I want to translate my research into a parody NRA website. I'll utilise satire as a means to entertain my audience while making them think more deeply about the NRA, the power it wields, and the implications of this power. As artists and designers we are communicators and thus have an obligation to think critically about what it is we are communicating and why. We are not only tastemakers but change makers; we have the power to provoke thought and inspire change. I believe we also have a moral imperative to speak truth to power and in my own small way, that is what I intend to do with my NRA Parody.</p>
