        <p> The website is intended to be as simple and functional as the NRA's site is. There will be an ever-present header. Below that, per the NRA's site, there will be a navigation bar that features a drop-down menu and a repetition of the site's title and logo. The drop-down menu will contain six linked pages and each link will lead to satirical replications of the NRA's actual pages. For example, the Corporate Ethics page will lead nowhere. The page themselves may also link to satirical content, for example, each card on the News page will link to an article that I have written. The Donate Now Button on the Donate page will trigger a blurb about the NRA's registration as a non-profit agency despite profiting millions annually. My goal is not to create anything particularly beautiful or fancy, instead, it is to come as close to replicating the NRA's site as possible. </p>
